## Dataset
[Student Mental Health Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahashfaqvirk/student-mental-health-survey?resource=download)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because, as a former student-athlete, I have firsthand experience with the challenges of balancing academic responsibilities, physical health, and mental well-being. During my time as an athlete, I struggled with an injury that made it difficult to keep up with schoolwork, maintain a proper sleep schedule, and commit to rehabilitation due to time constraints. This experience made me realize how critical mental health is. When your mind is not in a good place, it can negatively impact your body and overall well-being. I want to explore how various factors such as academic pressure, social relationships, and physical activity, influence mental health in students and how these insights can help create a more supportive environment for those facing similar challenges.
